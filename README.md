# Singular Value Decomposition

In this repository, we will explore the singular value decomposition (SVD) of matrices and its applications. Here is a brief overview of the repository structure:
```
singular-value-decomposition
├── homework/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── __init__.py
|   ├── homework_scratch.ipynb
|   ├── image.png
│   ├── task_1.py
│   ├── task_2.py
│   └── task_3.py
├── README.md
└── class_notes.ipynb
```
As before,
- **homework/**: Contains the instructions and template files for the assignment. You will edit the template files directly to complete the homework.
- **README.md**: Is this file you are reading right now.
- **class_notes.ipynb**: Is what you will edit directly to write notes during class.
