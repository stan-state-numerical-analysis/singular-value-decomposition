# Homework Instructions

Below the __init__.py file, you will see one Jupyter notebook file with the name homework_scratch.ipynb, and image file, and three Python files with the following names: task_1.py, task_2.py, task_3.py. Each of these Python files contains a task for you to complete, those tasks have been copied into the Jupyter notebook. To complete the task, edit the **.py** file directly and commit changes as you make them. You may use the Jupyter notebook for scratch work, but **your final code needs to be in the corresponding .py file**. Do not edit the contents of the __init__.py and README.md files.

## Homework folder structure
``` 
homework/
├── README.md
├── __init__.py
├── homework_scratch.ipynb
├── test_image.png
├── task_1.py
├── task_2.py
└── task_3.py
```
Your final code needs to be contained in the **bottom three files**. You do not need to include scratch work in the provided Jupyter notebook if you do not find it necessary.
